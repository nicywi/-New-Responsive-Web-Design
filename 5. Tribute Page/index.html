            <h2 id="headline">Here's some information about Salvador Dali's life:</h2>
            <p id="long-text">Salvador Dali was a Spanish painter, sculptor, and visionary who became one of the most
                celebrated and controversial artists of the 20th century. He was born on May 11, 1904, in Figueres,
                Spain, and spent most of his life exploring the realms of the subconscious and the bizarre.
                <br><br>
                Dali is best known for his surrealist paintings, which depict dreamlike landscapes, melting clocks,
                distorted faces, and other surrealistic imagery. His works often combined elements of illusion, fantasy,
                and eroticism, and were heavily influenced by his own psychological obsessions and fears.
                <br><br>
                One of Dali's most famous works is "The Persistence of Memory," (seen above) painted in 1931. The painting features a
                surreal landscape with melting clocks draped over tree branches and a distorted face in the background.
                It has become an icon of the surrealist movement and a symbol of Dali's unique artistic vision.
                <br><br>
                Dali's artistic career spanned over six decades and encompassed a wide range of mediums, including
                painting, sculpture, photography, and film. He collaborated with other artists and filmmakers, including
                Luis Buñuel, on a number of groundbreaking projects that pushed the boundaries of art and storytelling.
                <br><br>
                In addition to his artistic achievements, Dali was known for his eccentric personality and flamboyant
                public appearances. He was a master of self-promotion and often created sensational headlines with his
                bizarre stunts and public statements.
                <br><br>
                Despite his fame and success, Dali never stopped experimenting and pushing the limits of his own
                creativity. He continued to create new works until his death in 1989, leaving behind a legacy that has
                inspired generations of artists and art lovers around the world.
                <br><br>
                Salvador Dali was a true master of surrealism and a visionary artist who dared to explore the unknown
                depths of the human mind. His legacy lives on through his art, which continues to fascinate and
                challenge us to this day.
